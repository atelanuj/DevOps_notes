# GitHub Actions CI/CD

## [**The components of GitHub Actions**](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/about-github-actions/understanding-github-actions#the-components-of-github-actions)

- You can configure a GitHub Actions **workflow** to be triggered when an **event** occurs in your repository, such as a pull request being opened or an issue being created.
- Each job will run inside its own virtual machine **runner**, or inside a container, and has one or more **steps** that either run a script that you define or run an **action**, which is a reusable extension that can simplify your workflow.
